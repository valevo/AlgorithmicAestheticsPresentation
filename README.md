# Algorithmic Aesthetics Presentation


# What is aethetics?

 - what things can have aesthetic value?
 - what are the ingredients of aesthetic value?
 - can aestethics be defined at all independent from individual perspective? which aspects are cultural/biological/universal?

## Wittgenstein

 - cultural aspect of aesthetics: rules emerge in society about how things "ought" to be; an individual aesthetic judgement about a thing is an expression to the adherence of that thing to the rules of society <br>
 => comment: this aspect of aesthetic judgements is extra-individual, in the sense that any individual who knows the rules would make similar judgements
 => comment: the _simplicity_ of a thing conditioned on the rules of society is equivalent to the thing's _adherence_ to those rules

 - according to W., creative inventions don't break with all of the old rules but still adhere to the great many of them


# How can aesthetics be formalised?

 - 
 
 
 
# Simplicity correlates with Aesthetic Value

 - simplicity <=> complexity, can be mathematically formalised and measured by computers
 
 - the other way around: aesthetics as a principle in selecting theories and proving 
    => choice of theories or proofs done by aesthetic value when indistinguishable otherwise 
    => simple, and therefore more aesthetic objects/events/theories, are more likely according to most theories of complexity
    
 - connection between simplicity and likelihood connects neatly to theories about aesthetics based on predictability - that which is more easily
 predicted is judged to have higher aesthetic value (think about principles of symmetry, grouping, geometric shape)
 
 

# Miscellaneous Notes

 - applying automated aesthetic measurements/judgements to the music produced by/with our Neural Net fits into the agenda of using AI as a mirror for ourselves: <br>
   it is arguably impossible for us to explore certain areas of the musical space, but this can be done with the help of our Neural Net; the measured aesthetic value of music in such areas and our own subjective judgements in comparison shed light on our aesthetics and taste
