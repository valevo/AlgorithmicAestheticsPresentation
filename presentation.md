# -1. Why?

- Algorithmic Aesthetics = aesthetics of art produced by algorithms? or = aesthetic judgements by algorithms? (spoilers: in this section, it is the latter)

- usually, when computer science meets art, the computer scientist's job is done (and sent back to the dark basement) once the tool is created <br>
  -> artists then discuss the aesthetics of the created art among themselves <br>
  -> this section is a computer scientist's perspective on such a discussion 
  
- my opinion: putting aesthetics, specifically the aesthetics of the music created by our AI, into an algorithmic perspective is not just an excercise 
  but can also enrich the discussion: <br>
  it helps to connect to concepts and lines of thought not previously considered (also in a sense of providing feedback) <br>
  it can help understand better what AI does and how it changes out environment (including music) <br>
  it provides yet another mirror to our understanding of music as a whole and specifically the aesthetics we treat it with
  


# 0. Disclaimer

 - aim of this section: we'll be looking at aesthetics from a computer science perspective which means translating it into mathematical concepts (don't worry, you won't see any formulas)
   
 - it is doubtable whether human aesthetics can be fully captured by mathematics at all; <br>
   so, at least for the moment, no approach can fully cover the nature of what humans find aesthetically valuable; <br>
   on a related note, aesthetics likely has strong subjective aspects, so there likely isn't a unified/objective theory that works for any human and any context
   
 - with this in mind, the approach to measuring aesthetics I present in the following is only **one** approach of many neither me nor the original authors 
   would claim that it perfectly captures human aesthetics <br>
   it is remarkable, however, how close to human we can get by the argument and method, especially seeing how **simple** it is 
   (this is a play on words, simplicity will be a core concept
   
 - so this story is to be taken more as prototypical story from algorithmic science and less as "the" solution
   
# 1. Wittgenstein on Aesthetics

  - famous and highly influential philosopher of mind, language and science in the first half of the 20th century
  
  - has become somewhat of a favourite to AI and cognitive scientists for providing philosophical foundations 
  
  - his account of aesthetics is from the notes taken during a few lectures

## 1.1 What is an Aesthetic Judgement?

  - Wittgenstein starts with the observation that people tend to use words like "right" or "correct" when making aesthetic judgements
    (and not so much "beautiful" which is used more as a gesture) <br>
    e.g. "this is the right way of reading Goethe's poem", at the tailor: "make the sleeve a bit shorter for the right length"
    
  - the crucial question then becomes: how have people learned in which situations to use the word "right"? <br>
    note: with this question in mind, aesthetic judgements are closely connected to linguistic expression
    
  - Wittgenstein's answer: in order to make aesthetic judgements, 

## 1.2 "Rules"


# 2. Towards Simplicity: "Rules" and the Predictive Brain

## 2.1 "Rules"

  maximum simplicity conditioned on the rules is equivalent to maximum adherence to those rules

## 2.2 The Predictive Brain

  attempting to avoid uncertainty, the brain strives to surround itself with simple things
  hence, when we surround ourselves with art made by ourselves, that art will be simple
  
  
# 3. Simplicity and the Computer


- simplicity can be conditional: different observers may find the same object differently simple because of their individual previous experiences <br>
  crucially, this aspect can be captured in mathematics/computer science => I won't go into this now
